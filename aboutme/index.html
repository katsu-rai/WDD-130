    <h2>Rai Katsuragawa</h2>
    <p>
      Hello everyone. I am Rai Katsuragawa. I am from Gifu, Japan. I am majoring
      in Computer Scinece. In my free time I like to study Chinese language (I
      took CHIN101 last semester), lift weights, watch a movie, play sports, and
      listen to music. After I get the degree, I would like to get a job in the
      field of Metaverse. I think it is really cool how much potential it has
      and it can change the world.
