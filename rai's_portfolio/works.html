            I achieved a lot of things. I increased the harvest amount of rice
            by performed duties such as tilling soil, applying fertilizer, and
            pesticides, transplanting, weeding, thinning. Also, I kept track of
            data about how rice was growing up and decided how much fertilizer
            needed put in. It resulted in 20% increase of harvest amount.
            Furthermore, I supervised working schedule of production team and
            quality check outcomes of each task.
