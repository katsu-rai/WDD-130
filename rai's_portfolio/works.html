        <h3>Rice Farmer</h3>
        <p>Jan 2021 - Aug 2022</p>
        <p>
          I achieved a lot of things. I increased the harvest amount of rice by
          performed duties such as tilling soil, applying fertilizer, and
          pesticides, transplanting, weeding, thinning. Also, I kept track of
          data about how rice was growing up and decided how much fertilizer
          needed put in. It resulted in 20% increase of harvest amount.
          Furthermore, I supervised working schedule of production team and
          quality check outcomes of each task.
