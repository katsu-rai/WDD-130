I found that chances were not fair between us and people in a city. However, with technology, I could have online high quality class with a teacher living far away. Also, I could get connected with a lot of people to know the world. From my hometown, people rarely study abroad but I talked to a person who I met through online and I knew about the path of studying abroad and I am studying in the U.S. now. I want to bring a good change into someone’s life with technology. I have strong passion to help others experience the power of technology as I felt.
