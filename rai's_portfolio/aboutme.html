      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Name: Rai Katsuragawa<br />
        From: Japan<br />
        Skill Sets: HTML, CSS, Python<br />
        Like: sports, work out, piano, nature, a trip, try new things<br />
        Language: English, Japanse<br />
        Background: I was born and raised in Japan. In my free time, I like to
        do things I mentioned above.<br />
        Passion: I grew up as generation Z being surrounded by technology.
        Technology was always there and helped me a lot to maximize my chance. I
        grew up in hometown. I found that chances were not fair between us and
        people in a city. However, with technology, I could have online high
        quality class with a teacher living far away. Also, I could get
        connected with a lot of people to know the world. From my hometown,
        people rarely study abroad but I talked to a person who I met through
        online and I knew about the path of studying abroad and I am studying in
        the U.S. now. I want to bring a good change into someoneâ€™s life with
        technology. I have strong passion to help others experience the power of
        technology as I felt.<br />
